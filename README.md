### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your D: drive. This is necessary for the system to track the correct file locations. If the repository is not cloned to the D: drive, you will need to adjust the file paths in the code.
2. **Java Requirements**: Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system. These are essential for running the application.

### How to Run the Application
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to your D: drive using the command `cd D:\`.
   - Clone the repository using `git clone <repository-url>`.
   
2. **Adjust File Locations (if necessary)**:
   - If you cloned the repository to a different location, open the source code files.
   - Update the file paths in the code to match your repository location.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Create a shortcut to the `.exe` file in a convenient location.
   - Run the application by double-clicking the shortcut.

By following these steps, you can set up and run the Library Management System, leveraging its features to enhance the efficiency and user experience of library operations.
